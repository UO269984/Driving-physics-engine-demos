# Dreg demos

Demos of using the [Dreg](https://github.com/UO269984/dreg) driving physics library. 

Currently the only demo available features an interactive vehicle in a 3D environment, developed with Unity. This can be run on Windows, Linux and Android with the files available in the [latest release](https://github.com/UO269984/dreg-demos/releases/latest). It can also be run on its [web version](https://uo269984.github.io/TFG/demoUnity/) (this one is not compatible with mobile devices).
